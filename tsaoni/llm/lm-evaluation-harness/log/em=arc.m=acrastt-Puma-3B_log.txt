Ethanol is a type of alcohol made from plants. Sugarcane and corn, which are both used in foods such as cereals and breads, are used to make ethanol. Burning ethanol provides a clean source of energy because the products of ethanol are water and carbon dioxide. Therefore, mixing ethanol with gasoline reduces harmful waste products. In the 1970s, many Brazilians drove cars with engines that used an ethanol gasoline mixture. This alternative fuel conserved the limited supply of gasoline available at that time. In the 1990s, gasoline became cheaper than ethanol, and Brazilians returned to driving more gasoline-fueled cars. Recently, Brazilians started driving more cars that use an ethanol-gasoline mixture. Which group would benefit most if drivers in the United States fueled their vehicles with an ethanol-gasoline mixture?

When estimating amounts of building supplies, it is better to allow for some waste and error rather than to cause delays by not ordering sufficient supplies. An engineer is estimating the number of bundles of shingles needed for a roof area of approximately 2000 sq. ft. In roofing, a square is 100 sq. ft., and each bundle covers one-third of a square. Which of the following is closest to the number of bundles that the engineer should order?
